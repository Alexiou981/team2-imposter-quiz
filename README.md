## User Experience

### Project Goals

The aim of this app is to create a quiz game designed to challenge the negative thoughts associated with imposter syndrome — a feeling that is particularly common among people working in the IT field, where the fast-changing environment makes it impossible to know everything at once.
This game was created to help learners and professionals alike recognise that self-doubt is normal, and mistakes are part of the learning process — not a sign of failure.
The game is intended for coders at all stages of their learning journey. The questions are designed with a beginner-friendly approach, offering imposter-syndrome-busting coding questions in a multiple-choice format. 


### User Stories

- As a user I want to have access to a home page so that I can find out general info about the quiz.
- As a user I want to have easy access to the game's instructions so that I can understand how to play.
- As a new learner of coding, I often feel like I’m not smart enough and doubt whether I’ve chosen the right career path, especially when I struggle to understand the code. I would like a relaxing game that shows me it’s normal to have these thoughts while learning something new.
- As a user I want to be able to play the game seamlessly so that I can have a pleasant experience when the imposter syndrome takes over me.
- As a coder, I want a game that will help beat my imposter syndrome on my mobile phone, when I need a break, so I can crack on with my work.
- As an experienced coder who knows that I know nothing, I want a place to chill out, so I can relax and come back to work refreshed.
- As a person who sometimes doubts themselves, I would like a quiz game which is challenging, but not too much, so when I resolve some task or question, I feel better.
- As a remote worker who often feels isolated, I want a game that reminds me I’m part of a global community of learners, so I don’t feel alone in my struggles.
